# API dermasync

## Description - English

This repository contains the backend service for the DermaSync project ([www.dermasync.com.br](https://www.dermasync.com.br)) â€” a platform designed to extract and deliver insights from the collective experiences of people living with atopic dermatitis.

It implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that processes user-generated content from online communities (such as Facebook, Telegram, and Reddit). Using semantic vector embeddings, the system retrieves relevant segments and generates actionable insights to support patients in making informed decisions about their treatment.
